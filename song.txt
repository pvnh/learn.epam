I spoke to god today,
And she said that she's ashamed.
What have I become, what have I done?
I spoke to the devil today,
And he swears he's not to blame.
And I understood, cuz I feel the same.
Arms wide open, I stand alone.
I'm no hero, and I'm not made of stone.
Right or wrong, I can hardly tell.
I'm on the wrong side of heaven,
And the righteous side of hell.
I'm on the wrong side of heaven,
And the righteous side,
Righteous side of hell.
